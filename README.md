## About
Autobuyer was developed as a personal project in quarantine in 2020 during the GPU shortage. Initially developed to buy out of stock Nvidia graphics cards, Autobuyer will take in a link to an out of stock product listed on Amazon or BestBuy and purchase that product when it goes in stock. Use files with the “am” suffix for Amazon links and files with the “bb” suffix for BestBuy links. Happy buying!
